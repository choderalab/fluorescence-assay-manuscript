# fluorescence-assay-manuscript

- `analysis/` - Here all the data is analyzed using either just a `rawdata` plotting script or the `bayes`ian methods that require [assaytools](https://github.com/choderalab/assaytools).
- `data/` - This is where the raw data is. There is also a table here defining what experiments we have and haven't done.
- `manuscript/` - This is where the manuscript is.
