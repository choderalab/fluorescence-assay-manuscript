## Determination of critical aggregation concentration of kinase inhibitors in binding assay conditions

We adopted the confocal static light scattering based critical aggregation concentration assay (cSLS-CAC) [ref1] to screen for kinase inhibitor solubility in our binding assay buffer using a multiwell plate format. 
A Tecan EVO 200 liquid handler was used to dispense 100 uL of Kinase Binding Assay Buffer (20 mM Tris, 0.5 mM TCEP, pH 8.0) into a 96-well plate (MP-223SH, Phenix Research Products). 
Stock solutions of 10 mM ligand (or 3 mM ligand, depending on solubility) dissolved in DMSO were prepared using the Quantos QB5 automated liquid and powder dispensing system. 
Ligand stock solutions were then dispensed into the plate with the HP D300 Digital Dispenser, targeting a linear dilution series composed of 24 concentration points, starting from 20 uM and going down to 8 nM. 
Plates were mixed for 2 minutes in three different directions using the Inheco Incubator-Shaker DWP plate shaker, then were centrifuged in the Thermo Scientific Sorvall Legend XTR centrifuge at 1470 x g for 60 seconds. 
Measurements were collected in a Wyatt DynaPro III Plate Reader immediately after centrifugation. 
Relevant DynaPro III settings in Dynamics software version 7.8.0.26 used were peak radius low cutoff: 1 nm, acquisition time: 5 seconds, number of acquisitions: 5, auto-attenuation: enabled. 
The plates were read at 25°C without a seal. The measurement of each plate contained a dilution series for 4 different ligands and SLS measurement took about 50 minutes. 
We also measured SLS of a dilution series of DMSO to represent the background signal level without any aggregation present: equal volumes of DMSO as in ligand dilution series were dispensed into the buffer with the HP D300. 
After collecting measurements in the DynaPro III, the fluorescence spectra of the plates were read using the Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro.
At least three independent cSLS-CAC measurements were performed. 
Plates with replicate titrations were prepared on different days, using the same DMSO stock solutions of kinase inhibitors. 
For the determination of CAC, we analyzed the trend of normalized intensity (Cnt/s) values vs concentration from all replicates and determined the highest concentration after which SLS signal significantly increases above the background (SLS signal of the corresponding amount of DMSO titrated into the buffer) consistently.

All kinase inhibitors were purchased from LC Labs.
