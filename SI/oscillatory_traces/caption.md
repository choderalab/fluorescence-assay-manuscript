### Figure caption.

**Various assay formats result in different shapes of fluorescence traces.** **A.** The assay was carried out in two design formats- single well (Figure 5A) and multiple well (Figure 2B). Both assay formats were tested with and without dialysis of the proteins into the assay buffer. The single well assay was conducted in various plate formats (Figure S6). **B.** The shape of some fluorescence traces changed with different assay formats. This difference in shape was more prominent for protein:ligand pairs with higher binding affinity, such as WT Src:Bosutinib (left), than pairs with lower binding affinity, such as Abl GK:Gefitinib (right). For higher affinity protein:ligand pairs, assay formats 1, 2, and 4, resulted in somewhat oscillatory fluorescence binding curves (left). Fluorescence increased with increasing ligand concentration until ~ 0.5 uM, decreased slightly, then increased again. Assay format 3 eliminated this oscillatory behavior. For lower affinity protein:ligand pairs, none of the assay formats resulted in oscillatory traces (right). **C.** The fluorescence binding curves only showed oscillatory behavior in the single well format and not the multiple well format, for multiple protein:ligand pairs (top panels). By using the optimal single well assay format-format 3- the fluorescence binding curves for the single well no longer exhibited oscillatory behavior and showed similar shapes to the traces from the multiple well format (bottom panels).
