**Various plate types used for the assay resulted in different levels of background fluorescence.** **A.** Plate A, the 96-well, clear, polystyrene UltraVision plate with a UV base from 4titude, resulted in the lowest background signal- the level of fluorescence when no ligand has been titrated into the protein solution. This plate resulted in a background fluorescence intensity of ~ 400 rfu (B). Plate B, the black, 96-well clear bottom plate treated with proprietary non-binding technology from Corning, resulted in the highest background signal (B). This plate resulted in a background fluorescence intensity of ~ 2,700 rfu. Plate C, the black, 96-well clear bottom plate made of cycloolefin from Greiner Bio-One, resulted in a background signal similar to that of Plate A. Plate C resulted in a background fluorescence intensity of ~ 800 rfu (B). **B.** Plates A and C result in low background fluorescence-less than 1,000 rfu-but are only capable of supporting a maximum fluorescence intensity of less than 10,000 rfu for p38:Bosutinib. Plate B results in a higher background fluorescence level but is capable of supporting a maximum fluorescence intensity of over 30,000 rfu for p38:Bosutinib.
