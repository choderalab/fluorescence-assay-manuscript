# Experiments relating to plate type

### These experiments were done by EEG in February & June 2019.

#### Plate layout for all single well experiments is according to the plate type excel file in this folder, unless otherwise stated. In multiple experiments, only one protein is used. In all single well experiments, wells A1, C1, E1, and G1 are empty.

## Experiments:

#### In all experiments, Bosutinib was dispensed into rows A & B, Bosutinib Isomer was dispensed into rows C & D, Erlotinib was dispensed into rows E & F, and Gefitinib was dispensed into rows G & H.
