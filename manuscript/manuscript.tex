% ABSTRACT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{abstract}

Understanding the specificity of kinase inhibitors has tremendous therapeutic significance. 
To predict inhibitor selectivity computationally, an iterative approach incorporating experimental measurements is ideal. 
This work describes the development of a high-throughput label-free fluorescent ligand-binding assay to measure inhibitor affinities. 
Taking advantage of the intrinsic fluorescence increase of a group of FDA-approved kinase inhibitors upon binding kinases, we are able to measure inhibitor binding affinity with small amounts of protein and without any fluorescent labels. 
This facilitates rapid characterization of a wide range of kinase inhibitors and kinase resistance mutants, within a system that can be reproduced identically in molecular dynamics simulations.

\emph{Keywords: kinase inhibitors, Src kinase, Abl kinase, imatinib, bosutinib, fluorescence}

Here imatinib is used to compete off the fluorescent ligand gefitinib. Thus binding affinities can be measured for even non-fluorescent ligands, expanding the applicability of this simple, direct, cheap, and automatable assay to innumerable other kinase inhibitors.
