Lab notebook for this assay can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11iGIYhl7d3VCI0ggmrhiw8DOHQENiy5yRMI6Wlz2c10/edit#)

Major changes:
  * Wrote new D300 script with all 16 plates, since we discovered D300 can do multiple dispensing (see test run [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PvRzqWa-JoxRDgkIv9Pmc38ZVYrubeUjg-ucZcVVNrM/edit#heading=h.y398jyp5mq6q))
  * Only doing top read
  * Only reading at ex 280 nm (cut out 340 nm)
  * Only reading emission wavelengths 440 nm, 480 nm, 520 nm, and 560 nm
  * EVO part of script takes ~ 6 minutes and Infinite takes ~ 6 minutes; assay is bw 4-4.5 hours in length

Old_buffer folder has data/results from the experiment done with buffer that was ~3 months old

New_buffer folder has data/results from the experiment done with new buffer
