The **single_well_spectra_log_y.pdf** is the normal rainbow plot. The x-axis is the 4 wavelengths (440, 480, 520, 560) and the y-axis is log fluorescence w/ the same scale on all plots (max 12,000 fluorescence units)

The **single_well_spectra_fluorescence.pdf** is just the fluorescence at 480 nm plotted over the concentrations. The x-axis is the log of concentrations beginning at 0 and going up to 20 uM. The y-axis is fluorescence units (max 11,000).
